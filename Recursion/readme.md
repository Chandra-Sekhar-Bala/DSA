<b> Why recursion? </b>
 - Helps to solve bigger problem in a simple and easy way.
 - Recursion can be converted to iteration

<b> Approach Recustion : </b> 
- Identify if we can breakdown problem into smaller problem
 - Write the recerence relation if needed 
 - Draw the recursion tree
 - About the tree :
    - Flow of function, how they are getting into stack
    - Focus on left tree and right tree calls
    - Use pen and paper first 
 - See how the value is returned at each step, see where the function call will come out

<br>

‚≠ê: Base condition = Condition where recursion will stop making further calls

<br>

<b>Variable in recursion </b>
 - Arguments
 - Return type
 - Body of the function
